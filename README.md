## Hi! I'm Rohaan and welcome to my Github profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data enthusiast and a professional who loves generating insights from data to help solve problems while being a storyteller with data. Through data analysis I have leveraged insights to create successful business case studies with cost optimizations over CAD $2 Million. I am firm believer that every professional needs to be empowered with Data-Literacy to maximize the data potential and thus I have played an essential role in supporting the development of data analysis tools with my previous employer. I am the type of person who will look to remove impediments for the team when trying to find solutions to existing processes. Collaborating to finding robust solutions to a problem are what energize me.

An intrinsic drive to be the best helped me accomplishing a Master's degree, Master of Applied Business Analytics - Technology Innovation Management from Carleton University. Here I got to learn advanced data analysis skills leveraging current and most innovative technologies, collaborating with like-minded peers and improve my soft-skills through delivery of presentations and reports.

ðŸ˜Ž Apart from analytics, I love traveling and photographing landscapes and cityscapes. I have traveled over 25 countries and my photos of Dubai were published by Emirates Airline as part of a tourism campaign on their in-flight entertainment system that ran across all flight destinations for 3 months.

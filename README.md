## Hi! I'm Rohaan and welcome to my Github profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data enthusiast and professional that loves telling stories with data and drawing insights from it to help solve problems. I have leveragedÂ insights gained through data analysis to produce profitable business case studies that included cost savings of more than CAD $3Â Million. I firmly believe that in order to fully utilise the power of data, every professional must be equipped with data literacy, and as such, I played a crucial part in supporting the development of data analysis tools forÂ my previous employer. I am the kind of person who will look to remove anyÂ impedimentsÂ for the team and often find myself asking "What can I do to help?".

An intrinsic drive to be the best helped me accomplishing a Master's degree, Master of Applied Business Analytics - Technology Innovation Management from Carleton University. Here I got to learn advanced data analysis skills leveraging current and most innovative technologies, collaborating with like-minded peers and improve my soft-skills through delivery of presentations and reports.

ðŸ˜Ž Apart from analytics, I love traveling and photographing landscapes and cityscapes. I have traveled over 25 countries and my photos of Dubai were published by Emirates Airline as part of a tourism campaign on their in-flight entertainment system that ran across all flight destinations for 3 months.
